# Thesis up front:
Developing a sense of cultivated curiosity through an interdisciplinary liberal arts education can equip you to succeed in the classroom and beyond (students AND faculty!!!)

# Agenda

* My Simpson journey
* Liberal arts and my research
* Building on your foundation

# About me

::::

 

## My Simpson journey

* 'Recruited' as math major (actually had my deposit in elsewhere)
* Liked the small college environment (smaller than my highschool)
* Knew I wanted to study abroad (Nicaragua!)

 ![](../img/nica.JPG)

## First classes

* Honors Liberal Arts Seminar in Philosophy
* Math: calculus
* Spanish

### Ultimately was a Math, Philosophy, and Spanish major with a Latin American Studies minor

## Zero chill but lots of fun

* Involved across campus
* Yearbook and newspaper
* Coffee shop
* Tutor + 'TA'
* Greek life
* Math club
* Math modeling competition

## Academic journey
Study abroad and math modeling competitions changed my life ... because I had a wide foundation to draw from

# Graduate school: 
 
* Pursued a PhD in Political Science
* University of Michigan for Complex Systems
* Knew I loved teaching

# An interdisciplinary life:

### Interdisciplinary research:
* Blends ideas from multiple disciplines
* May or may not have an interdisciplinary 'home base'
* Can provide broader and deeper insights because you have a rich range of theories and ideas


# Interdisciplinary work: an example

### Applications
* Epidemiological models can be used both to understand the spread of disease but also the spread of viral trends
* Systems dynamics models can be used to understand populations (e.g. predators and prey) but also how cultures evolve and change

# Personal and Professional life


* My work spans multiple disciplines—I collaborate with diverse colleagues and draw on different areas of training:
  * **Philosophy**: analytical thinking and argument construction
  * **Mathematics**: rigorous problem-solving
  * **Computer Science**: computational implementation
  * **Political Science**: synthesis of complex literatures, institutional analysis
  * **Sociology**: navigating cross-cultural and interpersonal dynamics
  * **Psychology**: construction of meaning and understanding, framing

## Small aside: An ongoing battle with a school district

* A district that is looking at numbers but not the bigger picture
* Lit reviews, collaborative teamwork, analysis, AND SO MUCH MORE!
* [Legion of Nerds: a group of parents fighting back with data](https://d65-legionofnerds.github.io/)

## Professional life: Music research

Political campaigns provide an opportunity for candidates to provide information about themselves and the representatives they will become. 


### Research project: It's a new soundtrack: Candidates, Campaigns, and Playlists

<br> 
**Campaigns provide**

* Opportunities to **signal their qualities** (delegate model (Mansbridge 2003, 2011))
* Information about their **'brand'** (gyroscopic model (Mansbridge 2003, 2011), 'brandidate' (Kaneva 2016, Harrison 2022))
* **Context** for voters (both informed and uninformed) (Bonilla 2022, Roumanias 2005)

## Theory: models of representatives

* **Delegate** models center on the notion of a representative as an agent on behalf of their constituents
  * Collective-focused
  * 'We' over 'I'
  * Principled: what is 'right' from an ethical or moral perspective
  
:::{.fragment}
* **Brand** model (Mansbridge's gyroscopic model) is centered upon the representative as the commodity 
  * Self-focused
  * 'I' over 'we'
  * Determines what is 'right' from own perspective
  * Typically resolute

## Context: Campaign music 
Campaign songs used for hundreds of years to connect with voters and send messages about candidates (Schoening and Kasper 2011, Peterson 2018). Technology makes it easy to curate and share playlists.

## Data
Data based on [Trax on the Trail Database](https://db.traxonthetrail.com/), focusing upon candidate-focused events (campaign launch, rally, stop, playlist, speech, town hall). Lyrics sourced from a combination of \url{genius.com} and \url{lyricsmania.com}.

* Approximately 2000 songs for candidates with more than five songs on a playlist and more than five campaign-related events.
* Approximiately 900 distinct songs represented
* 19 unique campaigns in 2016, 2020, and 2024

## Methods
Use of three primary methods:

* Lexicon-based text analysis (NRC Emotion Lexicon and Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC)))
* Topic Models (LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation))
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of relevant terms


## Themes: social behavior

```
:::

::: {.column width="40%" .v-center}
<br><br>

All candidates increased the use of songs with prosocial language over the elections with **Democratic candidates employing more moral language** in their song choices and Trump **nearly doubling** the ratio of prosocial language in playlists.

Trump has leaned toward more 'feel good'-type music while Harris had empowerment anthems.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA): explanation

* Principal Component Analysis offers a way to preserve the variation in the underlying data while reducing the number of variables present. 

* Variables are reduced through identifying relevant dimensions and collecting variables together. 

* Researchers name the dimensions thematically based on the variables present within the dimensional space



## PCA: Candidate 'spaces'
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="20%"}
:::{.fragment}
<br><br>
There are three distinct spaces: 

1. Linguistically focused (particular language and pronouns present)

2. Emotional

3. Analytical or logical language

## Why bother with all this?

* Problem solving skills
* Better insights
* Cooler at parties / work
* Able to move ahead because you can be a go-between

## STUDENTS!

* INQUIRY: what are you interested in? what can you learn about it?
* CULTIVATE your curiosity: approach questions from different perspectives
* FIND something that interests you: LIFE IS FOR LIVING and it's ok to do something for fun
  * Problem solving class w/Murphy Waggoner to think about how to bring what we know into the world
  * Philosophy of Language class w/John Pauley (and Prof Lieberman) on how we shape meaning and understanding
  * Music class w/Prof Albrecht and how major chords are coming home

* Bring in real-world context whenever you can!
* Teach cultivated curiosity ... and how to think about questions and answers
* Encourage and bring in different viewpoints

### What does this look like in the classroom? 

* Problem-solving classes
* Interdisciplinary teams
* Student autonomy and choice in assignments

# How did this get started?
