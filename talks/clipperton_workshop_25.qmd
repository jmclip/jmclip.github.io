## Background

Political campaigns provide an opportunity for candidates to provide information about themselves and the representatives they will become. 

<br><br>
**Campaigns provide**

* Opportunities to **signal their qualities** (delegate model (Mansbridge 2003, 2011))
* Information about their **'brand'** (gyroscopic model (Mansbridge 2003, 2011), 'brandidate' (Kaneva 2016, Harrison 2022))
* **Context** for voters (both informed and uninformed) (Bonilla 2022, Roumanias 2005)

## Theory: models of representatives

* **Delegate** models center on the notion of a representative as an agent on behalf of their constituents
  * Collective-focused
  * 'We' over 'I'
  * Principled: what is 'right' from an ethical or moral perspective

* **Brand** model (Mansbridge's gyroscopic model) is centered upon the representative as the commodity 
  * Self-focused
  * 'I' over 'we'
  * Determines what is 'right' from own perspective
  * Typically resolute
  

## Context: Campaign music 
Campaign songs used for hundreds of years to connect with voters and send messages about candidates (Schoening and Kasper 2011, Peterson 2018). Technology makes it easy to curate and share playlists.

# Focus and research questions
* **Themes** within the playlist music related to candidate archetypes, for example, themes of loyalty and specific personality characteristics. 

* Candidates' playlists incorporate different **emotions** and characteristics, with a focus on trust

* Different models of representation borne out in types of songs chosen:
  * **Delegate** models center on the notion of a representative as an agent on behalf of their constituents
    * 'We' over 'I'
    * Morality-focused
  
  * **Brand** model (Mansbridge's gyroscopic model) is centered upon the representative as the commodity 
    * 'I' over 'we'
    * 'Signature' elements, such as songs



## Data
Data based on [Trax on the Trail Database](https://db.traxonthetrail.com/), focusing upon candidate-focused events (campaign launch, rally, stop, playlist, speech, town hall). Lyrics sourced from a combination of \url{genius.com} and \url{lyricsmania.com}.

* Approximately 2000 songs for candidates with more than five songs on a playlist and more than five campaign-related events.
* Approximiately 900 distinct songs represented
* 19 unique campaigns in 2016, 2020, and 2024

## Methods
Use of three primary methods:

* Topic Models (LDA (Latent Dirichlet allocation))
* Lexicon-based text analysis (NRC Emotion Lexicon and Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC)))
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of relevant terms


## Sentiment and emotions: NRC

Using the NRC emotion lexicon, I incorporate eight emotions:

* Disgust
* Anger
* Fear
* Sadness
* Trust
* Anticipation
* Surprise
* Joy

## Sentiment and emotions

knitr::include_graphics("img/sentiment_camp_nrc.png")
```
:::

::: {.column width="30%" }
<br><br>
Overall, candidates from both parties incorporate songs with 'trust' as the most common emotion.

## Language and themes: LIWC
**Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC)** incorporates measures of linguistic use, which I use for its indicators of the following:

* **Linguistic terms:** 
    * pronoun use, such as I, we, she/he, and they
* **Analytic language:** use of logical language, including causal language 
* **Social terminology:** 
  * including prosocial language, moral language, and conflict
  * gendered terms/social references: male vs female

## Topics and themes: social behavior

<br><br>
All candidates increased the use of songs with prosocial language over the elections with Democratic candidates employing more moral language in their song choices.

## Candidate 'spaces'
There are three distinct spaces: linguistically focused (particular language and pronouns present), emotional, and analytical or logical language. I use this to name our respective axes and dimensions.

## Conclusions and future research

* Campaign music relevant to candidates and key differences across parties and campaigns:
  * Gender: more male-focused in Trump playlists over time
  * Pro-social language: all candidates increased, but particularly Trump
  * Moral language: reduction by Trump and increase by Democratic candidates
  * Generally more negative emotion by Democratic candidates but all candidates incorporated trust
